# Radar_disaggregation
Utility for radar and rain gauge data fusion.
How to use it?
(1) Decompress the .zip archive
(2) Run the Main_script_disaggregate.m script in Matlab. Depending on your application, you have to tune the parameters of the scripts (lines 1 - 27).

NB: Test datasets are available in the folders Test_dataset, Test_dataset2 and Test_dataset3. To use your own data you have to create a new folder with your data files in the same format than in e.g. Test_dataset. You may have to modify slightly the function read_raw_radar according to the format of your radar images.

NB2: Radar_disaggregation.7z must be considered as deprecated.
